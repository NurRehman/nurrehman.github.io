			<h1>Who I Am and What I’m Looking For</h1>
			<p>I have a strong desire to grow as a programmer. I am always striving to commit better code, and I want to work for a company that expects that of me. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the technologies I am familiar with, I pick up languages and frameworks quickly and would be happy to acquire new skills and knowledge. Culture is a very important consideration for me. I believe that a company should be fiercely competitive, but the same does not need to be true of it’s employees. A little competition is healthy, but I find myself thriving more in environments of collaboration, mutual respect, and with opportunities for learning, creativity, and mentorship. More than anything else, I want to work with people who truly believe in the product or service they bring to the market. Passion and dedication is highly contagious. I am interested in both front and backend positions, particularly when they deal with things like big data, data visualization, and data science. I am interested in companies which operate in all industries, but of particular interest are education, science, automotive, aerospace, real estate, finance, and information. I’d prefer to stay in Toronto area, but would entertain offers in other places as well.</p>
